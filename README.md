Here's a little bit about me.

## WORK:
### LinkedIn Bio:
Undergraduate student at Brown University double-concentrating in Electrical Engineering and International and Public Affairs. I am interested in the development, implementation, and regulation of renewable energy technologies, and aspire to bridge the gap between the political and technical aspects of the green energy transition. I am also extremely passionate about music, and enjoy applying my engineering skillset to radio, audio engineering, music production, and event management.
#### My Goals:
I'm hoping to familiarize myself more with some energy optimization models such as NREL's ReEDS, Energy Examplar's PLEXOS, and LEAP from the Stockholm Enviornment Institute. I'm also working to extracurricularly develop some GIS knowledge. 

## PLAY:
### Music:
I'm currently working on some Max for Live devices and enjoy experimenting with electronic music.
